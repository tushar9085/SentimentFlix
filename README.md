# SentimentFlix: IMDb Movie Review Sentiment Analysis (3_2 Project)

# Description
SentimentFlix is a unique project that uses machine learning to analyze the sentiments of movie reviews from IMDb. By training the model with 50,000 reviews, it has become moderately accurate(86%) in determining whether a review is positive or negative. With SentimentFlix, all you need to do is provide an IMDb review link, and the model will automatically scrape the reviews and predict their overall sentiment. It can be a powerful tool that helps movie lovers make informed decisions about the films they watch.
